	  Reiser4 is a filesystem that performs all filesystem operations
	  as atomic transactions, which means that it either performs a
	  write, or it does not, and in the event of a crash it does not
	  partially perform it or corrupt it.

	  It stores files in dancing trees, which are like balanced trees but
	  faster.  It packs small files together so that they share blocks
	  without wasting space.  This means you can use it to store really
	  small files.  It also means that it saves you disk space.  It avoids
	  hassling you with anachronisms like having a maximum number of
	  inodes, and wasting space if you use less than that number.

	  Reiser4 is a distinct filesystem type from reiserfs (V3).
	  It's therefore not possible to use reiserfs file systems
	  with reiser4.

	  Don't use this unless you are debugging reiser4.

	  If unsure, say N.
