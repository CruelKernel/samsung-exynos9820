/* We need a definition of the default node layout here. */

/* Generally speaking, it is best to have free space in the middle of the
   node so that two sets of things can grow towards it, and to have the
   item bodies on the left so that the last one of them grows into free
   space.  We optimize for the case where we append new items to the end
   of the node, or grow the last item, because it hurts nothing to so
   optimize and it is a common special case to do massive insertions in
   increasing key order (and one of cases more likely to have a real user
   notice the delay time for).

   formatted leaf default layout: (leaf1)

   |node header:item bodies:free space:key + pluginid + item offset|

   We grow towards the middle, optimizing layout for the case where we
   append new items to the end of the node.  The node header is fixed
   length.  Keys, and item offsets plus pluginids for the items
   corresponding to them are in increasing key order, and are fixed
   length.  Item offsets are relative to start of node (16 bits creating
   a node size limit of 64k, 12 bits might be a better choice....).  Item
   bodies are in decreasing key order.  Item bodies have a variable size.
   There is a one to one to one mapping of keys to item offsets to item
   bodies.  Item offsets consist of pointers to the zeroth byte of the
   item body.  Item length equals the start of the next item minus the
   start of this item, except the zeroth item whose length equals the end
   of the node minus the start of that item (plus a byte).  In other
   words, the item length is not recorded anywhere, and it does not need
   to be since it is computable.

   Leaf variable length items and keys layout : (lvar)

   |node header:key offset + item offset + pluginid triplets:free space:key bodies:item bodies|

   We grow towards the middle, optimizing layout for the case where we
   append new items to the end of the node.  The node header is fixed
   length.  Keys and item offsets for the items corresponding to them are
   in increasing key order, and keys are variable length.  Item offsets
   are relative to start of node (16 bits).  Item bodies are in
   decreasing key order.  Item bodies have a variable size.  There is a
   one to one to one mapping of keys to item offsets to item bodies.
   Item offsets consist of pointers to the zeroth byte of the item body.
   Item length equals the start of the next item's key minus the start of
   this item, except the zeroth item whose length equals the end of the
   node minus the start of that item (plus a byte).

   leaf compressed keys layout: (lcomp)

   |node header:key offset + key inherit + item offset pairs:free space:key bodies:item bodies|

   We grow towards the middle, optimizing layout for the case where we
   append new items to the end of the node.  The node header is fixed
   length.  Keys and item offsets for the items corresponding to them are
   in increasing key order, and keys are variable length.  The "key
   inherit" field indicates how much of the key prefix is identical to
   the previous key (stem compression as described in "Managing
   Gigabytes" is used).  key_inherit is a one byte integer.  The
   intra-node searches performed through this layout are linear searches,
   and this is theorized to not hurt performance much due to the high
   cost of processor stalls on modern CPUs, and the small number of keys
   in a single node.  Item offsets are relative to start of node (16
   bits).  Item bodies are in decreasing key order.  Item bodies have a
   variable size.  There is a one to one to one mapping of keys to item
   offsets to item bodies.  Item offsets consist of pointers to the
   zeroth byte of the item body.  Item length equals the start of the
   next item minus the start of this item, except the zeroth item whose
   length equals the end of the node minus the start of that item (plus a
   byte).  In other words, item length and key length is not recorded
   anywhere, and it does not need to be since it is computable.

   internal node default layout: (idef1)

   just like ldef1 except that item bodies are either blocknrs of
   children or extents, and moving them may require updating parent
   pointers in the nodes that they point to.

/* There is an inherent 3-way tradeoff between optimizing and
   exchanging disks between different architectures and code
   complexity.  This is optimal and simple and inexchangeable.
   Someone else can do the code for exchanging disks and make it
   complex. It would not be that hard.  Using other than the PAGE_SIZE
   might be suboptimal.
