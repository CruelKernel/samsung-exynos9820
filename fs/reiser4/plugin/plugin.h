/*
 * File plugin.  Defines the set of methods that file plugins implement, some
 * of which are optional.
 *
 * A file plugin offers to the caller an interface for IO ( writing to and/or
 * reading from) to what the caller sees as one sequence of bytes.  An IO to it
 * may affect more than one physical sequence of bytes, or no physical sequence
 * of bytes, it may affect sequences of bytes offered by other file plugins to
 * the semantic layer, and the file plugin may invoke other plugins and
 * delegate work to them, but its interface is structured for offering the
 * caller the ability to read and/or write what the caller sees as being a
 * single sequence of bytes.
 *
 * The file plugin must present a sequence of bytes to the caller, but it does
 * not necessarily have to store a sequence of bytes, it does not necessarily
 * have to support efficient tree traversal to any offset in the sequence of
 * bytes (tail and extent items, whose keys contain offsets, do however provide
 * efficient non-sequential lookup of any offset in the sequence of bytes).
 *
 * Directory plugins provide methods for selecting file plugins by resolving a
 * name for them.
 *
 * The functionality other filesystems call an attribute, and rigidly tie
 * together, we decompose into orthogonal selectable features of files.  Using
 * the terminology we will define next, an attribute is a perhaps constrained,
 * perhaps static length, file whose parent has a uni-count-intra-link to it,
 * which might be grandparent-major-packed, and whose parent has a deletion
 * method that deletes it.
 *
 * File plugins can implement constraints.
 *
 * Files can be of variable length (e.g. regular unix files), or of static
 * length (e.g. static sized attributes).
 *
 * An object may have many sequences of bytes, and many file plugins, but, it
 * has exactly one objectid.  It is usually desirable that an object has a
 * deletion method which deletes every item with that objectid.  Items cannot
 * in general be found by just their objectids.  This means that an object must
 * have either a method built into its deletion plugin method for knowing what
 * items need to be deleted, or links stored with the object that provide the
 * plugin with a method for finding those items.  Deleting a file within an
 * object may or may not have the effect of deleting the entire object,
 * depending on the file plugin's deletion method.
 *
 * LINK TAXONOMY:
 *
 * Many objects have a reference count, and when the reference count reaches 0
 * the object's deletion method is invoked.  Some links embody a reference
 * count increase ("countlinks"), and others do not ("nocountlinks").
 *
 * Some links are bi-directional links ("bilinks"), and some are
 * uni-directional("unilinks").
 *
 * Some links are between parts of the same object ("intralinks"), and some are
 * between different objects ("interlinks").
 *
 * PACKING TAXONOMY:
 *
 * Some items of an object are stored with a major packing locality based on
 * their object's objectid (e.g. unix directory items in plan A), and these are
 * called "self-major-packed".
 *
 * Some items of an object are stored with a major packing locality based on
 * their semantic parent object's objectid (e.g. unix file bodies in plan A),
 * and these are called "parent-major-packed".
 *
 * Some items of an object are stored with a major packing locality based on
 * their semantic grandparent, and these are called "grandparent-major-packed".
 * Now carefully notice that we run into trouble with key length if we have to
 * store a 8 byte major+minor grandparent based packing locality, an 8 byte
 * parent objectid, an 8 byte attribute objectid, and an 8 byte offset, all in
 * a 24 byte key.  One of these fields must be sacrificed if an item is to be
 * grandparent-major-packed, and which to sacrifice is left to the item author
 * choosing to make the item grandparent-major-packed.  You cannot make tail
 * items and extent items grandparent-major-packed, though you could make them
 * self-major-packed (usually they are parent-major-packed).
 *
 * In the case of ACLs (which are composed of fixed length ACEs which consist
 * of {subject-type, subject, and permission bitmask} triples), it makes sense
 * to not have an offset field in the ACE item key, and to allow duplicate keys
 * for ACEs.  Thus, the set of ACES for a given file is found by looking for a
 * key consisting of the objectid of the grandparent (thus grouping all ACLs in
 * a directory together), the minor packing locality of ACE, the objectid of
 * the file, and 0.
 *
 * IO involves moving data from one location to another, which means that two
 * locations must be specified, source and destination.
 *
 * This source and destination can be in the filesystem, or they can be a
 * pointer in the user process address space plus a byte count.
 *
 * If both source and destination are in the filesystem, then at least one of
 * them must be representable as a pure stream of bytes (which we call a flow,
 * and define as a struct containing a key, a data pointer, and a length).
 * This may mean converting one of them into a flow.  We provide a generic
 * cast_into_flow() method, which will work for any plugin supporting
 * read_flow(), though it is inefficiently implemented in that it temporarily
 * stores the flow in a buffer (Question: what to do with huge flows that
 * cannot fit into memory?  Answer: we must not convert them all at once. )
 *
 * Performing a write requires resolving the write request into a flow defining
 * the source, and a method that performs the write, and a key that defines
 * where in the tree the write is to go.
 *
 * Performing a read requires resolving the read request into a flow defining
 * the target, and a method that performs the read, and a key that defines
 * where in the tree the read is to come from.
 *
 * There will exist file plugins which have no pluginid stored on the disk for
 * them, and which are only invoked by other plugins.
