 * components. Additional component, referred to as "ordering" is used to
 * order items from which given object is composed of. As such, ordering is
 * placed between locality and objectid. For directory item ordering contains
 * initial prefix of the file name this item is for. This sorts all directory
 * items within given directory lexicographically (but see
 * fibration.[ch]). For file body and stat-data, ordering contains initial
 * prefix of the name file was initially created with. In the common case
 * (files with single name) this allows to order file bodies and stat-datas in
 * the same order as their respective directory entries, thus speeding up
 * readdir.
 *
 * Note, that kernel can only mount file system with the same key size as one
 * it is compiled for, so flipping this option may render your data
