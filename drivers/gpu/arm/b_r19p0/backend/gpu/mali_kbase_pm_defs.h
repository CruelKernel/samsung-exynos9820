 * @protected_transition_override : True if a protected mode transition is in

 * @protected_l2_override : Non-zero if the L2 cache is required during a

 * changed with kbase_pm_set_policy(). The change is protected under
 * kbase_device.pm.pcower_change_lock. Direct access to this from IRQ context
 * must therefore check for NULL. If NULL, then kbase_pm_set_policy() will
