/**
 * enum kbase_context_flags - Flags for kbase contexts
 *
 * @KCTX_COMPAT: Set when the context process is a compat process, 32-bit
 * process on a 64-bit kernel.
 *
 * @KCTX_RUNNABLE_REF: Set when context is counted in
 * kbdev->js_data.nr_contexts_runnable. Must hold queue_mutex when accessing.
 *
 * @KCTX_ACTIVE: Set when the context is active.
 *
 * @KCTX_PULLED: Set when last kick() caused atoms to be pulled from this
 * context.
 *
 * @KCTX_MEM_PROFILE_INITIALIZED: Set when the context's memory profile has been
 * initialized.
 *
 * @KCTX_INFINITE_CACHE: Set when infinite cache is to be enabled for new
 * allocations. Existing allocations will not change.
 *
 * @KCTX_SUBMIT_DISABLED: Set to prevent context from submitting any jobs.
 *
 * @KCTX_PRIVILEGED:Set if the context uses an address space and should be kept
 * scheduled in.
 *
 * @KCTX_SCHEDULED: Set when the context is scheduled on the Run Pool.
 * This is only ever updated whilst the jsctx_mutex is held.
 *
 * @KCTX_DYING: Set when the context process is in the process of being evicted.
 *
 * @KCTX_NO_IMPLICIT_SYNC: Set when explicit Android fences are in use on this
 * context, to disable use of implicit dma-buf fences. This is used to avoid
 * potential synchronization deadlocks.
 *
 * @KCTX_FORCE_SAME_VA: Set when BASE_MEM_SAME_VA should be forced on memory
 * allocations. For 64-bit clients it is enabled by default, and disabled by
 * default on 32-bit clients. Being able to clear this flag is only used for
 * testing purposes of the custom zone allocation on 64-bit user-space builds,
 * where we also require more control than is available through e.g. the JIT
 * allocation mechanism. However, the 64-bit user-space client must still
 * reserve a JIT region using KBASE_IOCTL_MEM_JIT_INIT
 *
 * @KCTX_PULLED_SINCE_ACTIVE_JS0: Set when the context has had an atom pulled
 * from it for job slot 0. This is reset when the context first goes active or
 * is re-activated on that slot.
 *
 * @KCTX_PULLED_SINCE_ACTIVE_JS1: Set when the context has had an atom pulled
 * from it for job slot 1. This is reset when the context first goes active or
 * is re-activated on that slot.
 *
 * @KCTX_PULLED_SINCE_ACTIVE_JS2: Set when the context has had an atom pulled
 * from it for job slot 2. This is reset when the context first goes active or
 * is re-activated on that slot.
 *
 * All members need to be separate bits. This enum is intended for use in a
 * bitmask where multiple values get OR-ed together.

 * @aliasing_sink_page:   Special page used for KBASE_MEM_TYPE_ALIAS allocations,
 *                        which can alias number of memory regions. The page is
 *                        represent a region where it is mapped with a write-alloc
 *                        cache setup, typically used when the write result of the
 *                        GPU isn't needed, but the GPU must write anyway.

 *                        partially for the allocations >= 2 MB in size.
 * @reg_lock:             Lock used for GPU virtual address space management operations,
 *                        like adding/freeing a memory region in the address space.
 *                        Can be converted to a rwlock ?.

 *                        zone of the GPU virtual address space.
 * @reg_rbtree_exec:      RB tree of the memory regions allocated from the EXEC_VA
 *                        zone of the GPU virtual address space. Used for GPU-executable
 *                        allocations which don't need the SAME_VA property.

 *                        ioctl to mmap system call. This helps returning unique
 *                        handles, disguised as GPU VA, to Userspace from base_mem_alloc
 *                        and later retrieving the pointer to memory region structure
 *                        in the mmap handler.
 * @pending_regions:      Array containing pointers to memory region structures,
 *                        used in conjunction with @cookies bitmask mainly for

 *                        GPU virtual address.
 * @event_queue:          Wait queue used for blocking the thread, which consumes
 *                        the base_jd_event corresponding to an atom, when there
 *                        are no more posted events.
 * @tgid:                 Thread group ID of the process whose thread created
 *                        the context (by calling KBASE_IOCTL_VERSION_CHECK or
 *                        KBASE_IOCTL_SET_FLAGS, depending on the @api_version).
 *                        This is usually, but not necessarily, the same as the
 *                        process whose thread opened the device file
 *                        /dev/malixx instance.
 * @pid:                  ID of the thread, corresponding to process @tgid,
 *                        which actually created the context. This is usually,
 *                        but not necessarily, the same as the thread which
 *                        opened the device file /dev/malixx instance.
 * @jctx:                 object encapsulating all the Job dispatcher related state,

 * @used_pages:           Keeps a track of the number of 4KB physical pages in use
 *                        for the context.
 * @nonmapped_pages:      Updated in the same way as @used_pages, except for the case
 *                        when special tracking page is freed by userspace where it
 *                        is reset to 0.

 * @mem_pools:            Context-specific pools of free physical memory pages.
 * @reclaim:              Shrinker object registered with the kernel containing
 *                        the pointer to callback function which is invoked under
 *                        low memory conditions. In the callback function Driver
 *                        frees up the memory for allocations marked as
 *                        evictable/reclaimable.
 * @evict_list:           List head for the list containing the allocations which
 *                        can be evicted or freed up in the shrinker callback.
 * @waiting_soft_jobs:    List head for the list containing softjob atoms, which
 *                        are either waiting for the event set operation, or waiting
 *                        for the signaling of input fence or waiting for the GPU
 *                        device to powered on so as to dump the CPU/GPU timestamps.
 * @waiting_soft_jobs_lock: Lock to protect @waiting_soft_jobs list from concurrent
 *                        accesses.
 * @dma_fence:            Object containing list head for the list of dma-buf fence
 *                        waiting atoms and the waitqueue to process the work item

 *                        fences.
 * @as_nr:                id of the address space being used for the scheduled in
 *                        context. This is effectively part of the Run Pool, because
 *                        it only has a valid setting (!=KBASEP_AS_NR_INVALID) whilst
 *                        the context is scheduled in. The hwaccess_lock must be held
 *                        whilst accessing this.
 *                        If the context relating to this value of as_nr is required,
 *                        then the context must be retained to ensure that it doesn't
 *                        disappear whilst it is being used. Alternatively, hwaccess_lock
 *                        can be held to ensure the context doesn't disappear (but this
 *                        has restrictions on what other locks can be taken simutaneously).
 * @refcount:             Keeps track of the number of users of this context. A user
 *                        can be a job that is available for execution, instrumentation
 *                        needing to 'pin' a context for counter collection, etc.
 *                        If the refcount reaches 0 then this context is considered
 *                        inactive and the previously programmed AS might be cleared
 *                        at any point.
 *                        Generally the reference count is incremented when the context
 *                        is scheduled in and an atom is pulled from the context's per
 *                        slot runnable tree.
 * @mm_update_lock:       lock used for handling of special tracking page.
 * @process_mm:           Pointer to the memory descriptor of the process which
 *                        created the context. Used for accounting the physical
 *                        pages used for GPU allocations, done for the context,
 *                        to the memory consumed by the process.

 *                        debugfs file.
 * @kctx_dentry:          Pointer to the debugfs directory created for every context,
 *                        inside kbase_device::debugfs_ctx_directory, containing
 *                        context specific files.

 *                        for dumping job fault debug info.
 * @job_fault_count:      Indicates that a job fault occurred for the context and
 *                        dumping of its debug info is in progress.

 *                        atom but before the debug data for faulty atom was dumped.
 * @jsctx_queue:          Per slot & priority arrays of object containing the root
 *                        of RB-tree holding currently runnable atoms on the job slot
 *                        and the head item of the linked list of atoms blocked on
