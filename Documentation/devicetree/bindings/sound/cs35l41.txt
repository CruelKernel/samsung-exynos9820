Optional H/G Algorithm sub-node:

  The cs35l41 node can have a single "cirrus,classh-internal-algo" sub-node
  that will disable automatic control of the internal H/G Algorithm.

  It is strongly recommended that the Datasheet be referenced when adjusting
  or using these Class H Algorithm controls over the internal Algorithm.
  Serious damage can occur to the Device and surrounding components.

  - cirrus,classh-internal-algo : Sub-node for the Internal Class H Algorithm
  See Section 4.4 Internal Class H Algorithm in the Datasheet.
  If not used, the device manages the ClassH Algorithm internally.
